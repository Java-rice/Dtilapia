# D'TILAPIA  
**Discrete Technologies & Innovative Language for Advanced Problem-Solving and Information Analysis**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

D'TILAPIA is a domain-specific, web-based programming language designed to make learning and applying **Discrete Mathematics** easier and more interactive. Built using **Python**, **Flask**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, this platform serves as both a syntax environment and a computational interpreter for operations such as:

- Set theory  
- Permutations and combinations  
- Trees and graph traversal  
- Arithmetic and geometric sequences  
- Prime checking, divisibility, GCD/LCM  
- Propositional logic evaluation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

D'TILAPIA aims to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical notation and real-world programming syntax, especially for students and educators in Computer Science and Math-related fields. It offers:

- Custom grammar for declarations, conditions, and loops  
- Rule-based evaluation similar to functional languages  
- Rich support for discrete math operations  
- A safe and easy learning environment
